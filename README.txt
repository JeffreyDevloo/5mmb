Welcome to 5-Minute Multiboxing!
You are now 5-Minutes away from Multiboxing.
Sucka.
Simply edit the sample toonlist.txt and replace the example toons with your
own.
Sucka.
Then, double-click 5mmb.bat to create your HotKeyNet run script (and update
your SM_Extend.lua with your toon names) and get ready to RUMBLE!
(NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE HKN RUNNING AT THIS POINT!)

The format of the toonlist is wordy but simple.
Simplest way to 5 box, toonlist example:
box accountname1 passwd shamantres healer
box accountname2 passwd cuppycake melee
box accountname3 passwd eversmile tank
box accountname4 passwd brutalic caster
box accountname5 passwd shamanuno hunter
monitor 1k

double click 5mmb.bat, answer yes to both questions.
Load resulting 5mmb_HKN.txt file into HotKeyNet
Hit Ctrl-Alt-m

You are boxing!

Consult the toonlist_command_reference.txt file for details.
